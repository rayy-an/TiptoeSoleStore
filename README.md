# TiptoeSoleStore
This website was created as part of my Cert IV I.T course at TAFENSW.

The scenario given was to build a website for an online, Australian shoe store. 
This website had a main focus on accessibility and the ability to run across a range of devices.
This website had to be simple to avoid distractions but ALSO be able to provide detailed information in a neat way.

This website can be viewed at https://reiyua.github.io/TiptoeSoleStore/

Video demonstration of website accessibility as part of the assessment can be viewed below:
